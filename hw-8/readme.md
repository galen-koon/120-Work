### Galen Koon, 50

## Week 8

This week was incredibly challenging for me. I simply could not grasp the for loops, and struggled mightily with being able to set the variables and getting something to call corectly. The parameters of the for loop still are very hazy to me. I tried to understand it by rereading the course material and examining classmate's code, as well as watching some videos on youtube by Shiffman, but still struggled. @michaelmusick helped me out at the end, but by that time I was honestly so exhausted I couldn't stay up later to actually complete what I had originally envisioned. I did get the ellipses to move vertically and cycle back around though, which is part of what I wanted to do. Overall, not the best week for me, I look forward to next week and putting the for loop to practice a bit more.
