["Hello World!" Sketch](https://galen-koon.github.io/120-Work/hw-3/)

## Summary of Week 3 Work
For this week, I had to download the empty-example from the website, and then copy it to my own repository. From here, I had to create a sketch in my sketch.js folder document using newly learned p5. This [sketch](https://galen-koon.github.io/120-Work/hw-3/) is the first thing I have created using p5, which apparently is a coding tradition.  I chose to have the background be orange, simply because it is one of my favorite colors. The code to create this was nothing too complicated, but it served as a good introduction to java and the possibilities of p5. I was also introduced to the index.html file type, which is an extremely important element in publishing to the web, which we will be doing a lot of.

### Issues
I did not have too many issues doing this assignment, though I thought I had one with the resolution of my text. I posted a new issue on the course repository, and @JonSwallow was able to help me out, as he experienced the same thing. Apparently it is nothing to worry about.

### Looking Forward
I really was fasinated by the video that we watched as an introduction to p5. I would love to learn more about the different possibilities of the coloring, as well as how to animate things.  Like clicking on the circle to change its color, or having the slider underneath it to do the same thing.  I am fascinated by the possibilities here.
