### Galen Koon, 50

## Week 6
This week was very challenging for me. I did not quite understand how objects worked, and was struggling with defining variables and objects inside of the different functions, such as draw or set up, and outside so that they were global.  I was able to figure it out by going through the examples as well as come of my classmates' code. The map function was also incredibly difficult, and it took me forever to figure out the correct order of variables in order for it to work.
I liked being creative with the algorithms, and being able to make something completely random every draw loop was really cool to see. It was interesting using some of the new math commands that we learned, as I could totally see them becoming increasingly useful with practice.

I look forward to refining my skills next week!
