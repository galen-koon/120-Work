## Galen Koon, Section 50

# Week Four

## What I Accomplished
This week was incredibly fun, albeit difficult.  I didn't have too many problems completing the self portrait other than some syntax errors which I was able to go back and fix myself. I found myself constantly referring to the lessons from the course website, which I found to be extremely helpful. In the end, I simply underestimated the amount of time this assignment would take. I feel more comfortable in p5 than I did last week however, and I am enjoying it immensely.

### Content
This week was all about shapes. I learned a lot of different shape commands, as well as different things that I can do to those shapes, such as add color, change the size, add stroke, and change the opacity.  I look forward to being able to customize them even further, such as the circle from one of the first p5 videos that was changing color when you clicked it. I want to be able to make them move and interact with each other.

I liked this assignment a lot because it forced me to get down and dirty with the p5 code, and forced a lot of repetition which helped to engrain the knowledge into my mind.
I chose to do a self portrait because I wanted to keep it a little bit more simple than a monster, simply because it is my first drawing. I chose some stylistic choices, such as the buttons and the pockets on the shirt.  I had issues with translating the pockets but figured it out after a little tinkering.  I also had issues with the noFill command, but after reading a post on the course repo about capitalization I figured that out as well. I chose to include my hair in this, which I wish I could texturize. That was the best I could do with the current knowledge though. It was fun picking out different colors for my clothes and skin, as well as designing the aesthetic of the face.
