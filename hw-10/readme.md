# Week 10

Functions are a very good way to improve efficiency and increase workflow. Instead of having to write five lines of code for a snowflake, I only had to write one in the draw function. I definitely plan on using functions more in my code from here on out.
This week, I tried to encorporate a couple different functions. This week had some challenges, mainly with the ability to translate the input parameters from the function definition to the draw function.
