## Galen Koon, Section 50

# Homework 11

This week, I struggled mightily with incorporating the for loop into my code, calling forth the objects. Simply put, I was using the incorrect language, and I eventually got it figured out with help issue 58, posted by @rachel_holton_burnett. I really like the idea of using OOP, vs what we have been doing, because it cleans up the code and is easier to write, read, and figure out where things went wrong. Creating an object outside of the draw loop is much cleaner in my mind, and I like the idea of bringing it into the draw loop after it has been created, similarly to how we can create functions that save space.
