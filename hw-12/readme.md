# Week 12 Homework

This week, I was able to grasp the logic behind OOP a little more, and was able to manipulate the objects in a smoother manner. I didn't figure out how to get the balls to not stick to each other though, as it seems entirely random in my code whether they do or don't. To combat this, I added a function where, if the balls are stuck together, you can click them to make them go away. Not ideal, but it cleans up the canvas. I tried and find a way to create a gap in the edge of the canvas, so that the balls would go through, kind of like a goal, but couldn't figure it out. I tried using conditional statements, saying that IF the ball hits the edge of the canvas, AND the pos.y is within a certain range, then the ball can go through. I also tried adding another if statement saying If the ball hits the edge of the canvas then it will be blocked. I couldn't figure out the correct combination of both. I also could not figure out how to draw hexigons on the soccer ball, so they are circles. I liked the idea of letting the mouse speed up the balls, and then when they crash into each other they slow back down again. This was a fun week, and I enjoyed trying to trouble shoot and problem solve. Thank you for a good semester.
