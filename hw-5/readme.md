## Galen Koon, 50

# Week Five

### Overview
This week was extremely challenging for me. I started with an image in my mind of what I wanted to create, and unfortunately was not able to complete it all the way. However, I discovered a lot about coding and a lot about problem solving, using code in ways that I had not planned on. Overall it was a fun assignment, though frustrating.

### Challenges
I had no idea how to time anything on it's own.  I understand how to do animations as they relate to the mouse, but independent things were very confusing.  I wanted to create a stoplight that would flash the red, yellow, and green lights in an orderly and timed manner, where only one light was on at a time.  However, I could not figure out how to do it. I tried a lot of different techniques, ranging from using the if() command to using for(), millis(), and finally a combination of the frameRate() and the %.
This ended up being my final code for the timing, and though it does do the independent timing as the assignment specified, it does not accomplish my goal.
```
fill(((sin((frameCount/50)*10))* 255), 0, 0);
ellipse( width * .5, 220, 60);
```

Most of this was trial and error, with the help of various websites and webpages. [This webpage tutorial](http://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/changes-over-time/), as well as [this one](http://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/expressions-variables-and-loops/) were extremely helpful in getting me past my roadblocks. Allison Parrish, whoever you are, thank you. I also used the [reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/) from p5.js a lot, as I wanted to know more about various commands and functions.

### Accomplishments
I was able to fulfill the assignment parameters, and did a lot of problem solving on my own. It is extremely satisfying to look at what I created and know the work that went into it.  I used the course issues board for a few things, though my post never got answered, and my other post I was able to figure out before someone could answer.
